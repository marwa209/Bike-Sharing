# Bike-Sharing
Developed as coursework for Udacity "Deep Learning Fundamentals" Nanodegree. In this project, I built a neural network to predict daily bike rental ridership.
In this project, i made a neural network to solve a prediction problem in a real dataset! The Neural network was built from "scratch", using only NumPy to assist.By building a neural network from scratch, you will understand much better how gradient descent, backpropagation, and other important concepts of neural networks work. You also get a chance to see your network solving a real problem!

Programming language:
All the code in runs in Python 3 without failing, and all unit tests pass

Tools:
TensorFlow
